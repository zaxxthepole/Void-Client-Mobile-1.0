**VoidClient** is a modular, high-performance utility client designed for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition**. Built with a strong focus on stability, packet-level control, and extensibility, WClient delivers advanced combat, movement, and visual enhancements while maintaining a clean, maintainable architecture.

VoidClient does **not** modify game memory directly and is engineered for compatibility across multiple Bedrock environments.
